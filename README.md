#Data from a survey of stock market investors 

The document contains data from a survey of stock market investors. The data include investors' investment return rate, gender, age, marital status, income and other individual characteristic variables, as well as subjective financial literacy, objective financial literacy and the degree of overconfidence calculated from this. It also includes variables that measure risk appetite and trading frequency. The survey was conducted in July 2020.

1. We divided the financial literacy of individual investors into subjective financial literacy and objective financial literacy, and modified the setting of questionnaire questions to improve the convenience and consistency of the survey. Subjective financial literacy was tested in the form of Likert scale. There were five statements related to stock trading and policy cognition, and respondents were asked to choose one of the five choices indicating their attitudes: strongly agree, agree, disagree, disagree or strongly disagree. Each option is assigned 4, 3,2, 1 and 0 points respectively from high to low. The five questions are summarized, and the score obtained represents the score of subjective financial literacy. The theoretical interval is [0,20]. The objective financial literacy test takes knowledge of six representative stocks or stock markets, with two points for each question answered correctly and zero points for each question answered incorrectly. The score of each subject obtained by each respondent was summed up, namely, its objective financial literacy score, and the theoretical score range was [0,12].

The degree of overconfidence of investors can be expressed by dividing the difference between subjective financial literacy and objective financial literacy by the ratio of objective financial literacy, namely:

{over}_i=\dfrac{{sub}_i-{ob}_i}{{ob}_i}

2. In order to fully reflect investors' appetite for risk, we designed six multiple choice questions to directly or indirectly test investors' risk attitude and one fill-in-the-blank question based on absolute risk aversion index. Among them, each multiple choice question is assigned 3, 2, 1 and 0 points according to the response from risk preference to risk aversion according to the option setting. Fill in the blanks as follows:
3. 
Suppose you are invited to pay to play a game, let you in a box containing 100 balls (50 red balls, 50 white balls) out of a random ball, if it is a red ball, you can get 2500 yuan; If it's a white ball, you get nothing. How much are you willing to spend to play this game?

The most you are willing to spend is __________ yuan.

The risk avoidance coefficient can be calculated by filling in the blanks. R_i{(W}_i)=(2500-2H_i)/(3125000-2500H_i+\ {H_i}^2) 

Then calculate the mean of risk aversion coefficient of all samples, and the samples with greater than the mean score 0, and the samples with less than the mean score 3. The total score of all questions is the risk preference degree of the respondents, and the range is [0,21].
